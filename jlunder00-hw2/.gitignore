#blanket ignored files (all files with the following extensions)
*.pdf

#if you would like to specifically include a file that would be ignored, you can do so by adding the specific filename and adding an ! in front of it, ex: !dontIgnore.txt

#any other relevent files (none for hw2); if you use one, add your IDE gitignore text here
